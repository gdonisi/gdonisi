# Hello

You were expecting some fancy GitHub profile README with colors, badges, and auto-updating graphs? Sorry to disappoint, but I know you weren’t going to read it anyway.

I'm Giovanni, but people call me _Zio Frank_. Yes, it’s longer than my actual name. No, that’s not how nicknames are supposed to work.  
A dear childhood friend gave me this nickname, and it stuck with me, so I still use it today.  

I’m a [Data Science & Machine Learning](https://corsi.unisa.it/informatica-magistrale/en/home) student, juggling between academia and my job as a Software Developer at [FOS](https://www.gruppofos.it/). I willingly chose this life, and I don’t know why either.  

I write code mostly in **Python** and **Java**, which means I spend half my time dealing with indentation errors and the other half wondering why everything in Java takes 10 lines.  
Occasionally, I build things. Some of them _kinda_ work.  

I know how to Google. I know how to plug USB sticks on the first try (especially Type-C).  

**Things I like**:
- Linux
- Stack Overflow
- Pizza
- Docker
- Gym
- Music

**Things I don’t like**:
- Merge conflicts
- JavaScript
- Meetings that could be emails
- Bugs
